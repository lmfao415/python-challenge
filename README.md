This repository contains two small projects involving Python analysis of two datasets provided in CSV format. 

* The first [PyBank](https://github.com/lmfao415/python-challenge/tree/main/PyBank) analysis 
takes financial data listed in budget_data.csv and returns the analysis text file. The financial data here is provided as a table of profits/losses per month over about seven years. 

 * Running the main.py file analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


[Here are the results](https://github.com/lmfao415/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/analysis/analysis.png)
